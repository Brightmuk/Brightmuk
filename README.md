My journey in software development began at Moringa School, where I gained a strong foundation in full-stack development. Over the years, I have honed my skills in UI/UX and frontend development using technologies such as Flutter for cross-platform development JavaScript and ReactJS. I have also worked extensively with NoSQL and SQL databases and APIs, ensuring seamless integration and data management in the applications I build.
